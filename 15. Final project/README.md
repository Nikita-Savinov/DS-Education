# Final project

This was my final project, where I applied all the skills I had acquired. The task involved solving a binary classification problem using pipelines, data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, and a confusion matrix. I achieved an excellent result, reaching a key metric score of 92% on ROC-AUC.
