# Project description 

The client is the bank's credit department. It is necessary to determine whether the marital status and the number of children a client has influence the likelihood of repaying a loan on time. The input data from the bank includes statistics on clients' solvency.

The research results will be taken into account when developing a credit scoring model, a specialized system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay the loan to the bank.
