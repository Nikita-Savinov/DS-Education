# Project Description

You are an analyst at GoFast, a popular scooter rental service. You have been given data on users from several cities and their scooter trips. Your task is to analyze this data and test various hypotheses that could help the business grow.

Users of GoFast's mobile app can use the service in two ways:

    Without a Subscription
    With an Ultra Subscription

The analysis will focus on understanding user behavior, trip patterns, and pricing strategies, with the goal of providing insights that could drive business growth.

# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore the data, create various diagrams and plots, and draw conclusions that could aid in strategic decision-making for the growth of the GoFast service.
