# Project Description

You are tasked with developing machine learning models for the dairy farm "Volny Lug." The farmer wants to expand his herd and needs objective tools to select cows based on milk production and taste quality. 
Using data provided by the pasture association "EcoFerma," your goal is to create two predictive models: one for forecasting annual milk production (target: â‰¥6000 kg) and another for predicting milk taste quality.

# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore and apply key machine learning algorithms to predict cow milk production and taste quality, focusing on regression and classification techniques.
